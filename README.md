## Open Source Karate (Repo coming soon) - v0.3 pre-alpha, 40% complete.
### Summary
In partnership with [Dan Samuelsson (@danielhsamuelsson)](https://github.com/danielhsamuelsson), we're working on the design and implementation of a [Bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) based Kyohan for our flavor of Goju-Ryu karate, and to aid our students training.

### Stack Breakdown
Coming soon...

## RelMANS (Private Repo) - v0.1 pre-alpha, 5% complete (On Hiatus)
### Summary
Earlier this year I was working on a Relationship Management System (RelMANS) to help myself organise my life and polycule. This project is currently on hiatus as I work on other higher-priority projects.

### Stack Breakdown
**With this project, I'm improving my:**
- Python development skills, as that is what the backend is based on.
- MySQL & relational database design / implementation skills.
- Data visualisation using [Plotly's Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and [Dash Cytoscapes](https://dash.plotly.com/cytoscape)
- Also my git & documentation skills
  - I still don't fully get what a PR is and my commenting/READMEs are adequate at best.

**Planned improvements will involve:**
- ETL implementation (system TBD, likely AirByte) as the planned interface and visualisation tools are Google Sheets & Notion
  - Google Sheets for ease of formatting & sharing with "stakeholders" (partners.)
  - Notion for implementation into my Life Management System (LMANS) which uses a workspace as my "second brain."

# ðŸ“« How to reach me:
## Obviously, if it's related to my code:
- Lodge an issue on the relevant repo
### Important Note:
**I am not a full-time developer, nor do I want to be.** I code for fun and to solve my own problems, nothing more.<br>
I try to keep my code up to date and relatively bug free, but I have a day job and a life. If something's not working for your use case, take a look at the code and try to fix it yourself! I would love someone to build on my projects and my code ðŸ¥°
