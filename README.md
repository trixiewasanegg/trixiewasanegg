Hello! My name is Beatrix/Trixie (she/her) and I am a big ol' nerd who's terrible at coding but wants to get better so here's my GitHub.

I've been working with computers my entire life, and am studying Computer Science at the University of Western Australia.

Currently, I'm working through understanding proper software engineering techniques, with my main project being [Video Concat](https://github.com/theres-a-bea/video-concat), purely as that software is used at my workplace and it needs to be working at least sorta well.
